# Summary

In this project, we will created CI/CD pipelines to deploy sample java application in 3 ways.
The continious integration steps remains same i.e building java application using maven but the continious deployment strategies changes(starting with ob vm deployment, then docker container and finally kubernetes cluster)

1. Deploy application on Tomcat server
2. Containerize the application and deploy on docker container
3. Deploy containerized application on kubernetes cluster
